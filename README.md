My name is Ian Fisher. In May 2022 I started exploring some gaps in my technical skills. Code should have source control, so here I am on GitHub.

These exercises help me learn by doing -- hand-crafting small, tested, and documented applications. Anyone might teach themselves these skills from published examples. For others like me, perhaps my getting-started code and documents will complement those resources.

Qt QML/Quick

I have much experience with Qt, but had never tried Qt QML/Quick. My investigations start there, in the qt-qml repository.

Qt For Python

I have some Python experience, mostly I/O with CouchDB. In the qt-for-python repository, I start learning about the Qt Company's bindings for Python.
