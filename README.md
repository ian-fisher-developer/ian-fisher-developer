My name is Ian Fisher. In May 2022 I started exploring some gaps in my technical skills. All non-trivial coding should have source control, so here I am on GitHub.

I hope my exercises are helpful for others. Anyone might teach themselves these skills from published examples, but perhaps my getting-started code and README notes will complement those resources.

Qt QML/Quick

I have much experience with the cross-platform C++ Qt libraries, but never had the opportunity to work with QtQML/QtQuick. My investigations start there, in the qt-qml repository.

Qt For Python

I have some Python experience, mostly I/O with CouchDB (noSQL databases of JSON documents via REST APIs). In the qt-for-python repository, I start learning about the Qt Company's bindings for Python.
