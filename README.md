My name is Ian Fisher. These are my personal investigations of technologies interesting to me.

In May 2022 I started exploring some gaps in my technical skills. All non-trivial coding should have source control, so here I am on GitHub.

I have much experience with the cross-platform C++ Qt libraries, but have never had the opportunity to work with QtQML/QtQuick. My investigations start there, in the qt-qml repository.

In the future I would like to try Qt for Python.

I hope my exercises are helpful for others. Anyone can learn these skills from published example, but perhaps my own code and README notes will save some time.
